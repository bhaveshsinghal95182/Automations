**Scheduling Automation**
---
This is just a normal implementation of mistral using ollama (because it was the only decent model other than phi3 that could run on my device). 

This is a smaller project for the jarvis and i am going to make several of these smaller automations, integrate them in jarvis and learn along the way 

+ If you want to use it just follow the json format and paste in your timetable it works pretty well i guess
