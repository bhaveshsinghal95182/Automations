# **Automation Repository**
---

This repo is just a collection of automations I’m throwing together because, well, why not? It currently holds my **scheduling bot** (which works pretty well, I guess) and will hold a lot more automations as I make them. 

### **What's in Here?**

#### 1. **Scheduling Bot**
- A small, straightforward bot using **mistral** via **ollama** to handle my schedule. It checks my timetable (which is stored in a JSON file) and tells me what I need to know.
- If you want to use it, just throw in your own schedule in the right JSON format. I’m not here to hold your hand—figure it out. It’s basic stuff.

#### 2. **Jarvis Integration** (coming soon)
- Yeah, I’m building Jarvis. This scheduling bot is just one piece of that bigger puzzle. You’ll see a lot more automations coming in here as I build this thing out.

### **How to Use This Repo**

1. **Clone It**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhaveshsinghal95182/Automations
   ```

2. **Update Your Schedule**  
   Replace the JSON with your own timetable if you want to use the scheduling bot. Again, it's simple JSON format—Google it if you're clueless.

3. **Run It**  
   Navigate to the bot folder and run the Python script. You’ll need **ollama** and **mistral** installed. Do your own homework on that.

### **Plans**
- More automations coming soon. I’ll just keep adding them here as I go. The goal is to integrate all of this into my **Jarvis-like system**.

---

### **Disclaimer**
This is my personal automation repository, so I really don’t care how anyone else uses it. But hey, if it helps you, good for you. Just don't expect any hand-holding from me.

Feel free to tweak or extend it as you keep adding to your repo!
